Still working on the page , facing some errors related to packages and trying to understand flask more . trying to put a button to upload a file but it doesn't work until now .






--------------------------------------------------------
The upload button is now work without database it will stored in (uploads file) 

and added show button file to see the dataset

The next stage will try to add clean button and connect it to the script of cleaning 
 

------------------------------
Until now I knew how to apply the models on the dataset in flask and can apply multiple model ,
In addition I was looking for the easiest library to to apply the visualization and I found one 
Library that we can work on it  without engaging with bootsttrab and json codes 
I did some testing with random dataset(iris)  to trying the models and the visualize part 

Know I'm waiting the data file from yaser to see what we can visualize
